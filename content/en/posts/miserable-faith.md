***Life***
   ***-- Allan Houston***

*Life can be good,*

*Life can be bad,*

*Life is mostly cheerful,*

*But sometimes sad.*

*Life can be dreams,*

*Life can be great thoughts;*

*Life can mean a person,*

*Sitting in court.*

*Life can be dirty,*

*Life can even be painful;*

*But life is what you make it,*

*So try to make it beautiful.*

Painful feelings fill my life, which makes me feel less happy in life. 
Sunset time is at 4pm every day, which horizon disappears in my eyes.
