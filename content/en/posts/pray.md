I want to pray to myself tonight. I am feeling too much mental anguish and want to leave this world in my sleep. I cannot bear the pain any longer. All my friends have moved away from this city, leaving me feeling so lonely and lost. I hate the person I've become. The isolation and despair have become overwhelming.

I pray to myself for understanding of my choice to end my suffering and find peace. I know my friends brought me joy in better times, and I hope they will be blessed with happiness. I'm ready to say goodbye to this life and hope I will welcome myself into my own embrace. I want to take away my sorrows and grant myself the serenity I could not find here.

I place my life in my own hands now. I pray I will guide myself gently on this final journey and lead me to a place free of pain. Though my heart is heavy, I find comfort in trusting myself. I know I will show myself mercy and compassion.
