I sit here, close my eyes, and that image repeatedly returns to my mind. I cannot forget that feeling — it was like being pushed off a cliff, the final straw that broke the camel's back. Your reflection appeared in the dreamlike mirror, only to be shattered by your own hands. If I could gather a fragment, I'd use my blood to honor the trust I once had. This is both a curse and a nightmare—a complete breakdown of trust. I don't trust what my heart feels, but I have no choice to believe my eyes and ears.   

My tears are shed solely for the person I once was.
