Hi Negative Emotion,

Everyone has days when they feel dejected or down. I understood and expressed empathy. Sometimes life is no comparison with numbers, because use the numbers can increase the total number, while life will only reduce. I am just a hurried passer in the life, which I feel powerless, desperate and miserable.

Incessantly, of course, pain around.

I will end with a quote from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

"Manys years later as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."

"For it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races cndemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth."

Best,

Dying man
