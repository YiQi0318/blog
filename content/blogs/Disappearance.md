In the event that I choose to disappear, I have made the conscious decision to treat it as an ordinary day, without any prior notice or communication. It may seem sudden, but I believe it is important for me to take this step without any expectations or attachments.

I am aware that overindulgence is the beginning of destruction. It is not essential for me to genuinely enjoy reading; rather, I simply feign interest in it. The path of self-discipline is undoubtedly challenging, and I resort to pretending to possess self-discipline. However, it is impossible to deceive oneself after successfully fooling everyone else. This topic has intrigued me enough to delve into research, yet contemplating the question itself fills me with trepidation. What is even more unsettling is the realization that many individuals who raise this perspective fail to provide a definitive answer to resolve it entirely. Perhaps I know the answer and why no one told us the answer.
