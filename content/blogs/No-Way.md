The darkness surrounded me, and I realised I was out of place, like a vine disconnected from its roots. Even if it blooms with flowers, it will soon wither away. Life can sometimes feel as still and quiet as the depths of the sea, and in that silence, a sense of emptiness may arise.

The depths of pain and suffering are beyond the reach of words to fully capture and convey. No combination of words can truly encompass the magnitude and intensity of such anguish. It is an experience that defies description and surpasses the limitations of language.
