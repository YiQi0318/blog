I collapsed and couldn't rise again. Realizing my path was mistaken, I lamented not reversing my steps or opting for an alternate path before my downfall. While I bear no aversion to the scent of the earth, the idea of becoming mere sustenance for the soil does not appeal to me. Despite several attempts, I was unable to stand. In desperation, I sought salvation through prayer, though I no longer remember whom I invoked; my failure to rise has erased that memory. Now, I blend into the muddy road, becoming part of it. Overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, and a sense of helplessness, I find myself at a standstill, powerless to change my predicament.
