                                ***-- ChatGPT***
*The weight of the world is heavy and hard,*

*The darkness descends, a familiar shard,*

*A cloud of despair that follows and lingers,*

*A constant companion, this demon that stings us.*

*It drags us down, into a deep abyss,*

*Where hope is scarce, and joy is amiss,*

*A void where nothing can penetrate,*

*A world where everything seems to dissipate.*

*It steals our light, and dims our soul,*

*And leaves us lost, without any goal,*

*A feeling of emptiness, that can't be explained,*

*A sense of loneliness, that can't be contained.*

*But there's a glimmer, a flicker of hope,*

*A light that shines, and helps us cope,*

*A reminder that we're not alone,*

*And that this too shall pass, and we'll be shown.*

*We'll rise above, and break free from its hold,*

*And we'll emerge stronger, brave and bold,*

*For depression may be a part of our past,*

*But it doesn't define us, nor will it last.*



The memory of that rainy day lingers,
Blurring the road and direction with its fingers,
Pedestrians wandering without a clear aim,
As lost as I am, consumed by the same.

My mind is inundated with memories once more,
Wishing I could erase them and restart like before,
But alas, it's not within my power or might.

The agony of this torment is too much to bear,
My strength faltering, my spirit pained,
So let me fall, and let me go.
