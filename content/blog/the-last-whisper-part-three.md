***Dear Supervisors,***  

Greetings, I am deeply thankful to have encountered you at a particular moment in my life. You are a genuine role model from whom much can be learned. You possess tangible qualities of true beauty, which extend beyond anything that can be read about in books. It is not the first time I've experienced such emotional highs and lows, and it's hard to recall all the details. Thanks for your patience and guidance in my academic and personal life. I remember the times we spent together in meetings, your guidance on my research direction, and every word of encouragement you offered, which fueled my passion for academia. I want to express my sincere gratitude once again. Ultimately, I hope to be considered a 'good' PhD student.

***Best wishes,***
