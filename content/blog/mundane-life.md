***No Man Is An Island*** 
        ***——John Donne***

*No man is an island entire of itself;*

*every man is a piece of the continent,*

*a part of the main;*

*if a clod be washed away by the sea,* 

*Europe is the less,* 

*as well as if a promontory were,* 

*as well as any manner of thy friends or of thine own were;* 

*any man's death diminishes me,* 

*because I am involved in mankind.* 

*And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;* 

*it tolls for thee.*

It is long time to excape the world, I lose the control of my real life. I am staying on the bed, like an island. Baby kittens are like tornadoes, they are coming so fast I can not catch them. 

I can not catch the time either.

And life,
And hope.
And so on...
