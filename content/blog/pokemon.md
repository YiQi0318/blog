Dear Diary,

Mon 5 Dec, cloudy.

It is a cloudy day, I feel a bit cold. I sit on my chair as usual, and see the pedestrians passing by so quickly through the window.

I konw I am waiting a clock, whcih meeting with the team members of project. I have sitted here one hour.

Open a paper, of couse, I do not want to read it. I try to give some analysis for myself from the title and abstract, obviously, I failed it. I have sitted here two hours.

The weather is so bad, I start to search news and solve some problems, that is, nothing related with the research, I do not why too many trifles fill my life. I have sitted here three hours.

Go to buy the meal deal, sitted again.

I think I should contact my GP once again, type some key words and find the apporment website. what a pity, sevice is unavaliable. I have sitted here four hours.

Time goes by.

Fri 16 Dec, sunny.

I got the seasonal flu and took a week off. I'm starting to get lost in the elusive time.
