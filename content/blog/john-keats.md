When I feel fears, sky will sob.

If there is one thing in the life that we wolud choose not to experience, it is the death of my heart. I have disbelief myself and put on a brave face to the world.

When I feel fears, sky will weep.

I am staying on the waiting list of the care association, death is, of course, invitable. I lose my way and its heartbreaking, others move on and I feel the passing of my heart has come too soon. 

When I feel fears, sky will cry.

The end of September, sandflass remembers the time I lost. I said goodbye to myself, it will be someone receive the message.

How long I can go to the end of my life.
