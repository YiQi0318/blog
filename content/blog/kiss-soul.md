I will kiss my soul, cause it empty.
I lose the hug, cause I am cold.
I am not walking, cause I am full of prejudice.
I am tired, I am leaving.

I see the script of life, and look at the lines, it says cannibalism.
No offense, no overreach.
I hide all the facts.
I am tired, I am leaving.

Time stopped two years ago, I stole it.
I want to pay back now.
It is time.
I am tired, I am leaving.
