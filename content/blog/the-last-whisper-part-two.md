***Dear Advisors and Consollists,***  

Greetings, hope this message finds you well, thanks a lot warm-up me when I felt low mood and support/teach me pass the storm of life. Like a ship reaching the end of its journey because it is too old to sail, I have faced many challenges that seemed insurmountable. You are the great people, always providing professional way to help me to solve some issues from daliy life. You are the only ones I can turn to when I feel utterly helpless, acting as true friends who have been by my side, offering companionship and comfort when I needed it the most. However, I recognize that every journey must come to an end, and I don't want to burden you further. I am aware of the negative energy that surrounds me, and I understand how difficult it must be for you to listen to me talk about my struggles. As you always say, I should face these challenges on my own. 

***Best wishes,***   
***Yi***
